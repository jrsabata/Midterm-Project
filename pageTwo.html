                <h2>In 1984, Ronald Reagan's quest for world domination was swiftly interrupted by a gang of interdimensional aliens called GWAR. By the year 1990, four years before grunge finally died, the band continued to corrupt the youth of the nation with their huge album release, "Scumdogs of the Universe". In total, GWAR has released 14 albums worth of bloody mayhem with plenty of music videos to match. From their numerous talk show appearances to their infamously brutal concerts, nothing is safe from the destruction of the Scumdogs! </h2>
